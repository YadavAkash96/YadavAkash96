## 😀 About Me

I'm Akash Yadav — an AI explorer, researcher, and master's student on a mission to build smart, explainable, and impactful AI systems. My current journey dives deep into **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **GenAI**, and **uncertainty-aware medical image segmentation**. I'm passionate about making AI models not only intelligent but also interpretable and robust.

Whether it's decoding medical scans with deep learning, improving time series explainability with attention-based LSTMs, or tinkering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, I love taking on challenging problems with curiosity and creativity.
